## Entanglement-Based Multiparty QKD System

### *Overview*

At the Technical University of Berlin, we have installed the ELVIS 1500 system with an additional PAM 800 module, developed by Quantum Optics Jena, to explore the potential of entanglement-based multiparty Quantum Key Distribution (QKD). This system was set up in December 2023 and serves as a pivotal element of our research into quantum communication and security.

### *Research Focus*

*1- Security assessment of QKD System*

As part of the Q-net-Q project, our research aims to enhance the security of QKD systems through a comprehensive evaluation of their vulnerabilities. We conduct a series of attacks on the system to analyze potential information leakage and identify security weaknesses. This analysis is crucial for developing essential protocols and strategies for pre-certifying the security of QKD systems.

*2- Cryptographic Protocols Beyond QKD*

In addition to evaluating vulnerabilities, our research explores the feasibility of implementing advanced cryptographic protocols into a QKD system. We are particularly interested in:

1) Conference Key Agreement: Facilitating secure multi-party communication.
2) Coin Flipping: Ensuring fair and unbiased digital agreements.
3) Bit Commitment: Securing transactions and commitments in digital spaces.

These efforts involve detailed investigations of the necessary software modifications required to integrate these cryptographic primitives into the existing QKD infrastructure.

### *Goals and Use Cases*

Goal: To enhance the security and functionality of QKD systems by identifying vulnerabilities and exploring additional cryptographic capabilities.

Realized Use Cases: Trusted QKD-ICT setups that ensure robust security for future quantum communications.
