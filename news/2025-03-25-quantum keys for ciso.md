With the approaching Q-Day—when quantum computers may become powerful 
enough to break today’s encryption methods—Quantum Key Distribution 
(QKD) is coming into focus as a protective measure. Although QKD 
holds great potential, its current area of application remains limited.
Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs) have legitimate concerns 
regarding security, cost, scalability, and integration. Early engagement
ith quantum technologies is essential to counter future threats.
